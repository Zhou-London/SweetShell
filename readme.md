## Introduce

This is a terminal tool for MacOS aiming to save the time of starting your development. Imaging such situtaion, you are going to build some crazy applications, but the thing is that there are so many things to "turn on". Maybe, your text editor, your remote server(through ssh), a terminal page for testing your server, another page for connecting to your database, or any other page that is using some terminal tools.

This takes a lot of time! And you might forgot some really important command, such as the command connecting to your database where you might want to open the website everytime to paste the url. That's not something really enjoyable!

And that's why _SweetShell_ is here, to help you start a project quickly. You can easily set up a configuration of your project, through typed in all the commands that you need. Once the program saved these commands, you are then able to execute all these commands on one click, and what's more crazy is that, you are also able to execute them on one click!

SweetShell can track all the terminal pages that it opened. So it can also close them for you on one click. Now the things is getting easier, start your environment, work! and then close your environment.
